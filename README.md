# ProjectR-POC
Proof of concept and prototype work for Project R

This Github project is work going into the initial proof-of-concept (POC) for a community created game styled around the trappings and legacies of Final Fantasy.

The idea behind a proof of concept is to show that an idea can be implemented without specifically worrying about the technical details. The POC is a prototype that quickly shows the feasibility of an idea without having to worry about the promise of what the final product may look like. Work on this prototype will most likely be thrown away and implementation details may be reworked for other reasons like performance or changing design specifications.

In order to gather opinions and burgeon some discussion into the details of how to actually implement Project R, this prototype has been started and is open up to all those with a computer who can run Unreal Engine 4. Fork and clone the prototype. Play around with adding assets. Change game logic. That's the purpose of this POC.
